# smoky

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of smoky group was to pull together air quality data into a site akin to [isithotrightnow](https://isithotrightnow.com/). 

We wanted to pull air quality data from authorities across Australia and present it in a way that would allow the public to see how recent air quality events relate to historical data. We also wanted to include information to guide decision making.  

# Things we worked on...

## deciding where to get data from

We ended up settling on NSW gov data, although this data is not ideal. The site will only let us download daily average AQI. 


## making a shiny app 

The shiny app starts with a pulldown for site choice and tells you whether air quality is very good, good, poor, very poor, or hazardous. That text is also colour coded. 

## grid plot

We have been working on replicating plot 3 on the [isithotrightnow](https://isithotrightnow.com/) site.
