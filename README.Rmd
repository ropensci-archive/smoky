The goal of smoky group was to pull together air quality data into a site akin to [isithotrightnow](https://isithotrightnow.com/). 

We wanted to pull air quality data from authorities across Australia and present it in a way that would allow the public to see how recent air quality events relate to historical data. We also wanted to include information to guide decision making.  

# Things we worked on...

## deciding where to get data from

It took us a while to decide which data to use. We ended up settling on NSW gov data, although this data is not ideal. The site will only let us download daily average AQI. We are waiting on a call back re accessing the API for [this site](https://aqicn.org/city/australia/nsw/randwick/sydney-east/), which may have more comprehensive and up to date data. 


## making a shiny app 

The shiny app starts with a pulldown for site choice and tells you whether air quality is very good, good, fair, poor, very poor, or hazardous, along with a recommendation how this might impact activities. 

The app also displays the grid plot, the gganimate gif, and links to a page where you can support the RFS. 

Stay tuned for a link once we work out how to host it on a server.... 

## grid plot

We have been working on replicating plot 3 on the [isithotrightnow](https://isithotrightnow.com/) site. 


![heatmap grid](https://isithotrightnow.com/output/066062/heatmap.png)

There is the version that Lizzie created for 2019. The colour coding is percentiles relative to monthly values. Note that the AQI value for Tuesday 10 Dec is too big for the box!

```{r grid, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="2019 AQI levels coloured by percentile", out.width = '100%'}

knitr::include_graphics("grid_plot.png")
```


The code to create Lizzie's grid plots is [here](/R/grid_plot.R) 

## gganimated historical change plot

We used this tweet as a model...

... and made this animated plot of AQI levels across 2019, colour coded by hazard level. You can find the code that generates these animations in the [smoky_john Rmd file](smoky_john2.Rmd). 

This plot captures 2019 data.
